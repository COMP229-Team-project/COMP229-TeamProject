# COMP229-Team Project-Group20

### Development Notes:

Currently the backend is capable of serving data from our MongoDB server
Steps to run server locally:

- from root project folder "COMP229-TEAMPROJECT" run a nodemon
- type http://localhost:3000/api into your browser to view the JSON

The front end is able to display previews of the survey in a local environment:
Steps to view surveys via front end:

- With the backend running (prior step), ng serve from the COMP229-TEAMPROJECT/Client folder
- There is a bug written somewhere, but navigate around a bit and it should work
